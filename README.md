Image evolution through genetic algorithms

![Astronaut](/examples/astro.gif)

Not a particularly efficient way of imitating images, but the point is to explore the generative aspect of one image's pixels slowly evolving towards another in a genetic fashion.

Images, represented as vectors, evolve across generations through random mutations on their pixel values and reproduction of best specimens (defined by their similarity with the target image).

The initial population can start from random noise or a source image.

Lots of room for improvement.
